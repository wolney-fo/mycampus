# My Campus

This project is the back-end service for a school forum application designed to facilitate academic discussions. The platform allows students to post questions, which can then be answered by teachers or fellow students.

The back-end is built to support a dynamic and interactive learning environment, with scalable APIs that ensure efficient communication between users. It’s designed to enhance the educational experience by promoting knowledge sharing and engagement.
